Authors of QDP
==============

The QDP API was designed as a part of the National Computational
Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory (http://www.lqcd.org/).
Many members of the Software Committee contributed to the design.

The libraries, example programs and some of the documentation were written
by James Osborn <josborn@physics.bu.edu>.  Much of the documentation was
written by Carleton Detar <detar@physics.utah.edu>.
