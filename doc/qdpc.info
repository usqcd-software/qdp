1 Introduction
**************

This is the detailed user's guide for the C binding of the QDP Data
Parallel Applications Programmer Interface developed under the auspices
of the U.S. Department of Energy Scientific Discovery through Advanced
Computing (SciDAC) program.

   The QDP Level 2 API has the following features:

   * Can specify a physical lattice of any size and number of
     dimensions.

   * Automatically handles the layout of the lattice across the machine.

   * Provides functions for creating and destroying fields on the
     lattice along with a large set of data parallel operations
     (logically SIMD) acting on all sites across the lattice or on
     subsets of these sites.

   * Allows creation of arbitrary subsets of sites.

   * All math operations are handled by the SciDAC QLA library which has
     optimized versions for SSE (Intel, AMD) and 440 (QCDOC, BG/L)
     architectures.

   * Allows asynchronous (non-blocking) shifts of lattice level objects
     over any permutation map of sites onto sites.

   * Automatically handles dependency of shifts and waits on the
     results only when needed.

   * Uses the SciDAC QMP library for communications which is available
     for all MPI platforms and QCDOC.

   * Provides some combined shift and linear algebra instructions for
     convenience and optimization.

   * Provides fill operations (filling a lattice quantity from a scalar
     value(s)), global reduction operations, and lattice-wide
     operations on various data-type primitives, such as matrices,
     vectors and propagators.

   * Has flexible I/O capabilities allowing reading and writing of all
     lattice fields and also global data.

   * Uses SciDAC QIO library for I/O which is compatible with the USQCD
     and ILDG standards.

2 Compilation with QDP
**********************

* Menu:

* Header and macros::
* Libraries::
* Nonuniform color and precision::


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Header and macros,  Next: Libraries,  Prev: Compilation with QDP,  Up: Compilation with QDP

2.1 Header and macros
=====================

The main header file for QDP is `qdp.h' and must be included in all QDP
programs.  This will automatically include any other header files that
are necessary for the specified number of colors and will also include
the QLA headers. Typically the user will want to select a prevailing
color and precision for the entire calculation.  This allows one to use
generic function names and datatypes, making it possible to change
colors and precision with a simple recompilation, if desired.  The
following macros can be defined by the user prior to including this
header file:

Optional       Choices           Default
Macros                           
`QDP_Precision''F', 1, 'D', 2    'F'
`QDP_Nc'       number of colors  3
`QDP_Colors'   2, 3, 'N'         3

Single quotes are required around nonnumeric values.  The
`QDP_Precision' macro sets the default precision to either single (1 or
'F') or double (2 or 'D').  The `QDP_Nc' macro sets the default number
of colors and can be any positive integer.  Note however that QLA may
have been compiled with a limit on the maximum allowed value.
`QDP_Colors' determines which QDP and QLA library versions will be used
for calculations.  It is automatically set to  _2_ when `QDP_Nc' is _2_,
_3_ when _3_, and _N_ otherwise.  If for some reason a users wishes to
work with the _N_ namespace for two or three colors, rather than the
more efficient _2_ or _3_ namespace, they may do so by setting this
macro to _'N'_ explicitly.

   The number of spins is fixed in QDP to be the same value that the QLA
library that QDP was compiled against has which defaults to 4.

   A sample preamble for double precision SU(3) reads

     #define QDP_Precision 'D'
     #define QDP_Nc 3
     #include <qdp.h>

with the include search path set to `QDP_HOME/include' and `QDP_HOME'
set to the home directory for QDP.  With such a preamble the generic
function names and datatypes are automatically mapped to the
appropriate specific types.  Of course the precision and color macros
can also be defined through a compiler flag, as in

   `gcc -DQDP_Precision=2 -DQDP_Nc=3 ...'

For SU(4) one might do

     #define QDP_Precision 'F'
     #define QDP_Nc 4
     #include <qdp.h>

2.2 Libraries
=============

Normally, it is necessary to link four QDP libraries for a given choice
of color and precision.  Other libraries may be required if mixing
precisions or numbers of color.  Routines involving only integers and
the random state are common to all choices.  Routines involving only
real or complex numbers are common to all colors.  Thus for single
precision SU(3) the required libraries are linked through

   `-lqdp_f3 -lqdp_f -lqdp_int -lqdp_common'

with the library search path set to `QDP_HOME/lib'.  Each library will
depend on the corresponding QLA library.  Also since global sums are
done in a higher precision, using them requires linking to QLA
libraries of the next higher precision in addition to the corresponding
conversion library.  For the above example one would also need

   `-lqla_f3 -lqla_f -lqla_d3 -lqla_d -lqla_df3 -lqla_df -lqla_int
-lqla_random -lqla_cmath -lm'

in addition to the QIO and QMP libraries which typically are

   `-lqio -llime -lqmp'

and any other system dependent libraries such as MPI.  A complete list
of the QDP libraries is given below.

Name               Purpose
`libqdp_common.a'  QDP utilities
`libqdp_int.a'     integer and boolean
`libqdp_f.a'       real and complex single
                   precision
`libqdp_d.a'       real and complex double
                   precision
`libqdp_df.a'      real and complex precision
                   conversion
`libqdp_f2.a'      2 color single precision
`libqdp_d2.a'      2 color double precision
`libqdp_df2.a'     2 color precision conversion
`libqdp_f3.a'      3 color single precision
`libqdp_d3.a'      3 color double precision
`libqdp_df3.a'     3 color precision conversion
`libqdp_fn.a'      N color single precision
`libqdp_dn.a'      N color double precision
`libqdp_dfn.a'     N color precision conversion

2.3 Nonuniform color and precision
==================================

Users wishing to vary color and precision within a single calculation
must use specific type names and function names whenever these types
and names differ from the prevailing precision and color.  If using
different colors that the specified value then one must also include
the necessary headers.  For example, if a single precision SU(3)
calculation also uses some SU(2) datatypes or operations, the following
preamble is appropriate:

     #define QDP_Precision 'F'
     #define QDP_Nc 3
     #include <qdp.h>
     #include <qdp_f2.h>

and the following linkage to get the corresponding libraries:

`-lqdp_f2 -lqdp_f3 -lqdp_f -lqdp_int -lqdp_common'

   Note that the single, double and conversion headers for the
prevailing color are automatically included through `qdp.h'.  Only when
mixing colors does one need to specify individual headers.

   The following table lists all the QDP headers.

Name                   Purpose
`qdp.h'                Master header and QDP utilities
`qdp_int.h'            integers, boolean
`qdp_f.h'              real, complex, single precision
`qdp_d.h'              real, complex, double precision
`qdp_df.h'             real, complex, precision conversion
`qdp_f2.h'             SU(2), single precision
`qdp_d2.h'             SU(2), double precision
`qdp_df2.h'            SU(2), precision conversion
`qdp_f3.h'             SU(3), single precision
`qdp_d3.h'             SU(3), double precision
`qdp_df3.h'            SU(3), precision conversion
`qdp_fn.h'             SU(N), single precision
`qdp_dn.h'             SU(N), double precision
`qdp_dfn.h'            SU(N), precision conversion

3 Datatypes
***********

The N_d dimensional lattice consists of all the space-time sites in the
problem space.  Lattice data are fields on these sites.  A data
primitive describes data on a single site.  The lattice fields consist
of the primitives over all sites.  We do not define data types
restricted to a subset of the lattice - rather, lattice fields occupy
the entire lattice.

* Breaking Color and Precision Uniformity::


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Generic Names,  Next: Specific Types for Color and Precision,  Prev: Datatypes,  Up: Datatypes

3.1 Generic Names
=================

The linear algebra portion of the QDP API is designed to resemble the
Level 1 QLA API.  Thus the datatypes and function naming conventions
are similar.  As with QLA there are two levels of generic naming: fully
generic in which both color and precision may be controlled globally
through two macros and color-generic in which precision is explicit but
not color.  Generic naming applies to datatypes, module names, and
accessor macros and follows similar rules.

   Names for fully generic datatypes are listed in the table below.

Name                   Abbreviation   Description
`QDP_RandomState'      `S'            implementation dependent
`QDP_Int'              `I'            integer
`QDP_Real'             `R'            real
`QDP_Complex'          `C'            complex
`QDP_ColorVector'      `V'            one-spin, N_c color spinor
`QDP_HalfFermion'      `H'            two-spin, N_c color spinor
`QDP_DiracFermion'     `D'            four-spin, N_c color spinor
`QDP_ColorMatrix'      `M'            N_c \times N_c complex matrix
`QDP_DiracPropagator'  `P'            4 N_c \times 4 N_c complex matrix

The name for the corresponding primitive type, also known as the QLA
type, is obtained by replacing the `QDP' prefix with a `QLA' prefix.
Thus `QLA_ColorMatrix' is the primitive (QLA) type associated with the
field `QDP_ColorMatrix'.

   Names for color-generic datatypes are obtained by inserting `_F' for
single precision or `_D' for double precision after `QDP' where
appropriate.  Thus `QDP_D_ColorMatrix' specifies a double precision
color matrix with color to be set through a global macro.

   A long double precision type with abbreviation `Q' is defined for
QLA, but currently not for QDP.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Specific Types for Color and Precision,  Next: Color and Precision Uniformity,  Prev: Generic Names,  Up: Datatypes

3.2 Specific Types for Color and Precision
==========================================

According to the chosen color and precision, names for specific
floating point types are constructed from names for generic types.
Thus QDP_ColorMatrix becomes `QDP_PC_ColorMatrix', where the precision
`P' is `F' or `D' according to the table below

Abbreviation           Description
`F'                    single precision
`D'                    double precision

and `C' is `2', `3', or `N', if color is a consideration, as listed
below.

Abbreviation           Description
`2'                    SU(2)
`3'                    SU(3)
`N'                    SU(N)

If the datatype carries no color, the color label is omitted.  Integers
also have no precision label.  Likewise for functions, if none of the
arguments carry color, the color label is omitted, and if all numeric
arguments are integers, the precision label is omitted.  For example,
the type `QDP_F3_DiracFermion' describes a single-precision four-spin,
three-color spinor field.  The general color choice `N' can also be
used for specialized SU(2) or SU(3) at the cost of degrading
performance.

3.3 Color and Precision Uniformity
==================================

In standard coding practice it is assumed that a user keeps one of the
precision and color options in force throughout the compilation.  So as
a rule all functions in the interface take operands of the same
precision and color.  As with data type names, function names come in
generic and color- and precision-specific forms, as described in the
next section.  Exceptions to this rule are functions that explicitly
convert from double to single precision and vice versa.  These and
functions that do not depend on color or precision are divided among
thirteen separate libraries.  If the user chooses to adopt color and
precision uniformity, then all variables can be defined with generic
types and all functions accessed through generic names.  The prevailing
color and precision is then defined through macros.  The interface
automatically translates data type names and function names to the
appropriate specific type names through typedefs and macros.  With such
a scheme and careful coding, changing only two macros and the QDP
library converts code from one color and precision choice to another.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Breaking Color and Precision Uniformity,  Prev: Color and Precision Uniformity,  Up: Datatypes

3.4 Breaking Color and Precision Uniformity
===========================================

It is permissible for a user to mix precision and color choices.  This
is done by declaring variables with specific type names, using
functions with specific names, and making appropriate precision
conversions when needed.  In this case it may be necessary to link
against a larger set of libraries.

File: qdpc.info,  Node: Entry and exit from QDP,  Next: Layout utilities,  Prev: QDP Functions,  Up: QDP Functions

4.1 Entry and exit from QDP
===========================

QDP must first be initialized before any QDP functions are to be used
except for `QDP_is_initialized()' which may be called anytime.
Initializing QDP also initializes QMP if it has not already been done.
Thus the user can safely start QMP before QDP and do any necessary
broadcasts or other operations.  Before any QDP field operations are
done one must also create the  lattice layout.

Entry to QDP
------------

Syntax      `void QDP_initialize(int *argc, char ***argv);'
Meaning     Starts QDP.
Example     `QDP_initialize(&argc, &argv);'

The routine `QDP_initialize' is called once by all nodes and starts QDP
operations.  It initialiazes message passing (if not already done),
but does not setup the site layout (see `QDP_create_layout' and related
functions).  It also defines the global variable `int QDP_this_node;'
specifying the logical node number of the current node.

Exit from QDP
-------------

Syntax      `void QDP_finalize(void);'
Meaning     Exits QDP.
Example     `QDP_finalize();'

This call provides for an orderly shutdown.  It is called by all nodes.
It also finalizes QMP only if it was initialized by QDP.  If profiling
was turned on in any functions then node 0 will dump some statistics to
`stdout'.  Then it returns control to the calling process.

Panic exit from QDP
-------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_abort(int status);'
Meaning     Panic shutdown of the process.
Example     `QDP_abort(1);'

This routine may be called by one or more nodes.  It sends kill signals
to all nodes and exits with exit status `status'.

Check for initialization
------------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_is_initialized(void);'
Meaning     Checks if QDP is initialized.
Example     `if(!QDP_is_initialized()) QDP_initialize(&argc, &argv);'

Control profiling
-----------------

Syntax      `int QDP_profcontrol(int new);'
Meaning     Controls profiling.
Example     `old = QDP_profcontrol(new);'

Profiling results are only available for code that is compiled with the
macro `QDP_PROFILE' defined.  This must be defined before the qdp.h
header is included.  When `QDP_finalize' is called a list of QDP
function and call times will be sent to stdout on node 0.  This
function toggles the accumulation of the profiling statistics within
the profiled sections of code.  A value of zero turns the collection of
timing info off and nonzero values turn it on.  It is on by default.

Control checking communications
-------------------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_check_comm(int new);'
Meaning     Controls checking communications.
Example     `old = QDP_check_comm(new);'

A nonzero value turns the internal communications checksums on and zero
turns it off.  It is off by default.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Layout utilities,  Next: Naming Conventions for Data Parallel Functions,  Prev: Entry and exit from QDP,  Up: QDP Functions

4.2 Layout utilities
====================

The layout routine determines which nodes get which lattice sites and
in what linear order the sites are stored.  It has entry points that
allow a user to access single site data extracted from a QDP lattice
field.  The layout must be created before any operations on QDP field
objects are allowed.  If a user removes data from a QDP lattice object
(see `QDP_expose' or `QDP_extract') and wishes to manipulate the data
on a site-by-site basis, the global entry points provided here are
needed to locate the site data.

   The current QDP/C implementation allows only hypercubic layouts with
the same sublattice dimensions on every node.  It would be relatively
easy to add other layouts if the need arised.

Defining the layout
-------------------

Prior to creating the layout the layout parameters must be defined.
This is done through function calls.

Syntax      `void QDP_set_latsize(int nd, int size[]);'
Meaning     Sets number of spacetime dimensions and lattice size.
            No default.  Must always be set.
Example     `QDP_set_latsize(4, size);'

Syntax      `void QDP_create_layout(void);'
Meaning     Lays out the sites.
Example     `QDP_create_layout();'

   All layout parameters must be initialized through the `set' function
calls prior to creating the layout.

   After creating the layout the following global variables are
accessible.  The predefined lattice subsets for specifying even, odd,
and global subsets of the lattice:

   `QDP_Subset QDP_even, QDP_odd, QDP_all;'

   The even and odd subsets are elements of a two-element subset array
`QDP_even_odd', such that

     `QDP_even = QDP_even_odd[0];'
     `QDP_odd  = QDP_even_odd[1];'

   It also creates the nearest-neighbor shifts

   `QDP_shift QDP_neighbor[];'

   for each coordinate direction.  And finally the variable

   `int QDP_sites_on_node;'

   gives the number of sites assigned to a node by the layout utility.
Note that this may vary between nodes.

   The following global entry points are provided by the
`QDP_create_layout' procedure:

Number of dimensions
--------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_ndim(void);'
Meaning     Returns the number of dimensions.
Example     `ndim = QDP_ndim();'

Length of lattice in a given direction
--------------------------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_coord_size(int i);'
Meaning     Returns length of lattice in direction `i'.
Example     `nx = QDP_coord_size(0);'

Length of lattice in all directions
-----------------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_latsize(int latsize[]);'
Meaning     Returns lattice dimensions into array `latsize'.
Example     `QDP_latsize(latsize);'

Length of lattice in all directions
-----------------------------------

Syntax      `size_t QDP_volume(void);'
Meaning     Returns lattice volume.
Example     `vol = QDP_volume();'

Node number of site
-------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_node_number(int x[]);'
Meaning     Returns logical node number containing site `x'.
Example     `node = QDP_node_number(x);'

Linear index of site
--------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_index(int x[]);'
Meaning     Returns the linearized index for the lattice site `x'.
Example     `k = QDP_index(x);'

The linear index returned by `QDP_index' ranges from 0 to
`QDP_sites_on_node' - 1.

Number of sites on a node
-------------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_numsites(int node);'
Meaning     Return the number of sites on a node.  Same as
            `QDP_sites_on_node' if `node = QDP_this_node'
Example     `k = QDP_numsites(i);'

Map node and linear index to coordinate
---------------------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_get_coords(int x[], int node, int index);'
Meaning     Returns site coordinates `x' for the given node `node' and
            linear index `index'.
Example     `QDP_get_coords(x, 0, 31);'

Defining the spacetime coordinate
---------------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_I_eq_coord(QDP_Int *r, int i);'
Meaning     The `i'th spacetime coordinate.
Example     `QDP_Int *coord_z;
            QDP_I_eq_coord(coord_z, 2);'

The call `QDP_I_eq_coord(&coord[i],i)' fills an integer lattice field
`coord[i]' with a value on each site equal to the integer value of the
_i_th space-time coordinate on that site.

4.3 Naming Conventions for Data Parallel Functions
==================================================

Data parallel functions are described in detail in *note Function
Details::.  Here we desribe the naming conventions.  Data parallel
function names are constructed with a pattern that suggests their
functionality.  Thus the function

   `QDP_V_eq_M_times_V(c, u, b, s);'

   carries out the product

   `c[x] = u[x]*b[x];'

   for all lattice coordinates `x' belonging to the subset `s'.  where
_c_ and _b_ are pointers to lattice staggered fermion vector fields and
_u_ is a pointer to a lattice color matrix field.  The elements of the
function name are separated by an underscore (`_') for readability.
All function names in this interface begin with `QDP'.  The specific
name continues with a precision and color label as in
`QDP_F3_V_eq_M_times_V' for single precision _SU(3)_.  Then comes a
string of elements that mimics the algebraic expression.  The next
character `V' abbreviates the type for the destination operand, in this
case the argument `c'.  The abbreviations are listed in *note
Datatypes::.  The next string `eq' specifies the assignment operator.
In this case it is a straight replacement, but modifications are also
supported, as described below.  Then comes the first rhs operand type
`M' followed by a string `times' specifying the operation and a
character `V' specifying the second rhs operand type.

   Supported variants of the assignment operator are tabulated below.

Abbreviation   Meaning
eq             =
peq            +=
meq            -=
eqm            =-

   Some functions allow all of these and some take only a simple
replacement (eq).

Constant Arguments
------------------

In some cases it is desirable to keep an argument constant over the
entire subset.  For example the function

   `QDP_V_eq_c_times_V(c,z,b,s)'

   multiplies a lattice field of color vectors by a complex constant as
in

   `c[x] = z*b[x]'

   for `x' in subset `s'.  In this case we specify that the argument is
constant (coordinate-independent) by writing the type abbreviation in

Color argument for _SU(N)_
--------------------------

For the general color case _SU(N)_ the specific function requires an
extra argument giving the number of colors.  It always comes first.
Thus in the above example we would write

   `QDP_FN_V_eq_c_times_V(nc, c, z, b, s);'

   where `nc' specifies the number of colors.  In normal practice, the
variable `nc' should be replaced by the required user-defined macro
`QDP_Nc' specifying the prevailing number of colors.  The generic
function is actually a macro and is automatically converted to this
usage with `QDP_Nc' for the first argument.  However, if the specific
name is used, the user must supply the argument.

Adjoint
-------

The adjoint of an operand is specified by a suffix `a' after the type
abbreviation.  Thus

   `QDP_V_eq_Ma_times_V(c, u, b, s);'

   carries out the product

   `c[x] = adjoint(u[x])*b[x];'

   for all sites `x' in subset `s'.

Shift
-----

A shift in an operand is specified by a prefix lowercase `s' before the
type abbreviation.  (See the discussion of shifts below.) Thus

   `QDP_V_eq_sV(c, b, dir, sign, s);'

   shifts staggered fermion data along the direction specified by `dir'
and `sign' for all sites `x' in destination subset `s'.

Operations on arrays of fields
------------------------------

Some of the routines can operate on multiple fields at a time.  These
functions are designated by placing a `v' in front of the _eqop_
operator.  The allowed _eqop_'s are then `veq', `vpeq', `vmeq' and
`veqm'.  All arguments to the function are then made into arrays of the
type the original argument was _except_ for the subset.  Even scalar
values (QLA types) and other parameters are turned into arrays.  The
length of the arrays is then given as the last argument.  For example
the function

   `QDP_F3_V_peq_M_times_V(QDP_F3_ColorVector *r, QDP_F3_ColorMatrix
*a,
QDP_F3_ColorVector *b, QDP_Subset s );'

becomes

   `QDP_F3_V_vpeq_M_times_V(QDP_F3_ColorVector *r[], QDP_F3_ColorMatrix
*a[],
QDP_F3_ColorVector *b[], QDP_Subset s, int n );'

This has the same effect as the following code

   `for(i=0; i<n; i++) QDP_F3_V_peq_M_times_V( r[i], a[i], b[i], s );'

however it may be implemented in a more efficient manner (*note
Optimization Calls::).  It is permissible to have multiple array
elements point to the same field.  The result will always agree with
that of the above `for' loop.

4.4 Creating and destroying lattice fields
==========================================

All QDP fields are creted and destroyed with the following functions.
The alignment and type of memory (on architectures that support it) is
detrmined by the default alignment and flags (*note Optimization
Calls::).

Creating a lattice field
------------------------

Syntax      `TYPE * QDP_create_T(void);'
Meaning     Creates lattice field of type TYPE.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `u = QDP_create_M();'

In prototype specifications throughout this document the notation
_Type_ specifies the generic or specific datatype name matching the
abbreviation _T_ according to the table in *note Datatypes::.

Destroying a lattice field
--------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_destroy_T(TYPE *a);'
Meaning     Frees memory associated with field `a'.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_destroy_M(u);'


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Subsets,  Next: Shifts,  Prev: Creating and destroying lattice fields,  Up: QDP Functions

4.5 Subsets
===========

All QDP linear algebra and shift operations require specifying the
subset of the lattice on which the operation is performed.  The subset
may be the entire lattice.  When defining subsets, it is often
convenient to partition the lattice into multiple disjoint subsets
(e.g. time slices or checkerboards).  Such subsets are defined through
a user-supplied function that returns a range of integers 0,1,2,...,n-1
so that if f(x) = i, then site _x_ is in partition _i_.  A single
subset may also be defined by limiting the range of return values to a
single value (i.e. 0).  This procedure may be called more than once,
and sites may be assigned to more than one subset.  Thus, for example
an even site may also be assigned to a time slice subset and one of the
subsets in a 32-level checkerboard scheme.  A subset definition remains
valid until `QDP_destroy_subset' is called.

* Reductions on subsets::


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Defining a subset,  Next: Reductions on subsets,  Prev: Subsets,  Up: Subsets

Defining a subset
-----------------

Subsets are defined through the data type `QDP_Subset'

Syntax      `QDP_Subset * QDP_create_subset(int (*func)(int x[], void
            *args), void *args, int argsize, int n);'
Meaning     Creates an array of `n' subsets based on `func'.
Example     `QDP_Subset ts[nt];
            ts = QDP_create_subset(timeslice, NULL, 0, nt);
            where timeslice(x, NULL) returns x[3]'

   The extra arguments `args' are passed directly to the function and
saved in case the subset function is needed again when doing shifts
involving the subset.  Therefore the function should not depend on any
other global parameters that may change later in the program.  It is
permissible to call `QDP_create_subset' with n = 1.  In this case the
function must return zero if the site is in the subset and nonzero if
not.  (Note, this is opposite the _true_, _false_ convention in C).

Destroying subsets
------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_destroy_subset(QDP_subset s[]);'
Meaning     Destroys all subsets created with `s'.
Example     `QDP_destroy_subset(ts);'

This procedure frees all memory associated with the subset object _s_.
The `QDP_subset *' value _s_ should be the object returned by
`QDP_create_subset'.  All subsets in the array _s_ are destroyed.

Getting the size of a subset
----------------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_subset_len(QDP_subset s);'
Meaning     Returns the number of sites in a subset.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Reductions on subsets,  Prev: Defining a subset,  Up: Subsets

Reductions on subsets
---------------------

Reduction operations (norms, inner products, global sums) come in two
variants according to whether the result is computed on a single subset
of the lattice or on multiple subsets.  Thus the operation

       QLA_Complex z;
       QDP_ColorVector *a, *b;
       QDP_c_eq_V_dot_V(&z, a, b, QDP_even);

   sums the dot product of the lattice staggered fermion fields _a_ and
_b_ on the even sites and stores the result in _z_.  The operation

       QLA_Complex z[nt];
       QDP_ColorVector *a, *b;
       QDP_c_eq_V_dot_V_multi(z, a, b, ts, nt);

   with the timeslice subsets illustrated above computes the dot product
summed separately on each timeslice and stores the sums in the array
_z_, so that the value in _z[i]_ results from the sum on the subset
_ts[i]_.

4.6 Shifts
==========

Shifts are general communication operations specified by any
permutation of sites.  Nearest neighbor shifts are a special case and
are preinitialized by `QDP_initialize'. Arbitrary displacement shifts
are an intermediate generalization and are created with
`QDP_create_shift'.  Arbitrary permutations are created with
`QDP_create_map'.  However they are created, all shifts are specified
by a _direction_ label _dir_ of type `QDP_Shift' and a sign _sign_ of
type `QDP_ShiftDir' that takes one of two predefined values
`QDP_forward' and `QDP_backward'.

   Shifts are treated syntactically as a modification of a QDP argument
and are specified with a prefix _s_ before the type abbreviation for
the shifted field. Thus, for example,

   `QDP_H_eq_sH(r, a, dir, sign, s);'

shifts the half fermion field _a_ along direction _dir_, forward or
backward according to _sign_, placing the result in the field _r_.
Nearest neighbor shifts are specified by values of the global shift
`QDP_neighbor[mu]' with `mu' in the range [0, Ndim-1].  The sign is
`QDP_forward' for shifts from the positive direction, and
`QDP_backward' for shifts from the negative direction.  That is, for
`QDP_forward' and `dir = QDP_neighbor[mu]', r(x) = a(x+mu).  For more
general shifts, the direction _dir_ is specified by the object returned
by `QDP_create_shift' or `QDP_create_map' and _sign_ must be either
`QDP_forward' or `QDP_backward' to specify the permutation or its
inverse, respectively.

   The subset restriction applies to the destination field _r_.  Thus a
nearest neighbor shift operation specifying the even subset shifts odd
site values from the source _a_ and places them on even site values on
the destination field _r_.

File: qdpc.info,  Node: Creating displacement shifts,  Next: Creating arbitrary permutations,  Prev: Shifts,  Up: Shifts

Creating displacement shifts
----------------------------

Syntax      `QDP_Shift QDP_create_shift(int d[]);'
Meaning     Creates a shift defined by the displacement vector `d'.
Example     `int d[4] = {0,1,2,0};
            QDP_Shift knight[4][4];
            knight[2][3] = QDP_create_shift(d);'

The displacement vector points from the recieving site towards the
sender (or the opposite if later used with the `QDP_backward'
direction).  Calling with a displacement vector {1,0,0,0} would
reproduce the shift `QDP_neighbor[0]'.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Creating arbitrary permutations,  Next: Destroying a shift,  Prev: Creating displacement shifts,  Up: Shifts

Creating arbitrary permutations
-------------------------------

Syntax      `QDP_Shift QDP_create_map(void *(func*)(int rx[Nd], int
            sx[Nd], QDP_ShiftDir fb, void *args), void *args, int
            argsize);'
Meaning     Creates a shift specified by the permutation map `func'.
Example     `int mu = 1;
            QDP_Shift mirror[4];
            mirror[mu] = QDP_create_map(reflect, &mu, sizeof(mu));
            where reflect(rx,sx,QDP_forward,mu) sets sx[i] = rx[i]
            except for sx[mu] = L[mu] - 1 - rx[mu].'

The return value is used in the various linear algebra calls involving
shifts.  The arguments _args_ are passed through to the calling
function.  The _argsize_ parameter specifies the byte length of the
argument array or structure.

   The implementation may choose to postpone construction of a shift.
Thus it is required that the callback function _func_ be static and
invariant, i.e. a function call with the same arguments must give the
same result, even if the call is postponed.  The parameters _args_ are
copied at the moment the shift is created, however, so they may be
volatile.  The size argument _argsize_ makes copying possible.

Destroying a shift
------------------

The corresponding destruction function is `QDP_destroy_shift'.

Syntax      `void QDP_destroy_shift(QDP_Shift shift);'
Meaning     Frees memory associated with the map _shift_.
Example     `QDP_destroy_shift(shift);'

4.7 I/O utilities
=================

QDP provides a convenient interface to the QIO library which can read
and write any lattice field in the SciDAC format including ILDG
lattices.  It also provides routines for inserting metadata and global
binary data into the files.

* Opening and closing binary files::

* Reading and writing QLA arrays::
* String Handling::


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Opening and closing binary files,  Next: Reading and writing QDP fields,  Prev: I/O utilities,  Up: I/O utilities

4.7.1 Opening and closing binary files
--------------------------------------

As with standard Unix, a file must be opened before reading or writing.
However, we distinguish file handles for both cases.

Open a file for reading
.......................

Syntax      `QDP_Reader *QDP_open_read(QDP_String *md, char *filename);'
Meaning     Opens a named file for reading and reads the file metadata.
Example     `QDP_Reader *infile;
            QDP_String *file_xml = QDP_string_create();
            infile = QDP_open_read(file_xml, filename); '

The `QDP_Reader' return value is the file handle used in subsequent
references to the file.  A null return value signals an error. The I/O
system takes responsibility for allocating and freeing space for the
handle.  It is assumed the user has preperly created the `QDP_String'
that will hold the file metadata so it can be read from the head of the
file and inserted.  The volume format (see `QDP_open_write' below) is
autodetected,  so is not specified.

Open a file for writing
.......................

Syntax      `QDP_Writer *QDP_open_write(QDP_String *md, char *filename,
            int volfmt);'
Meaning     Opens a named file for writing and writes the file metadata.
Example     `QDP_Writer *outfile;
            QDP_String *file_xml = QDP_string_create();
            QDP_string_set(file_xml, xml_string);
            outfile = QDP_open_write(file_xml, filename, QDP_SINGLEFILE);
            '

The `QDP_Writer' return value is the file handle used in subsequent
references to the file.  A null return value signals an error. The I/O
system takes responsibility for allocating and freeing space for the
handle.  It is assumed the user has already created the file metadata
in `file_xml', so it can be written at the head of the file.  The
`volfmt' argument is either `QDP_SINGLEFILE' or `QDP_MULTIFILE'.
`QDP_SINGLEFILE' creates a single file for the output from all nodes
while `QDP_MULTIFILE' creates one file per node.

Close an input file
...................

Syntax      `int QDP_close_read(QDP_Reader *reader);'
Meaning     Closes an input file.
Example     `QDP_close_read(reader); '

Close an output file
....................

Syntax      `int QDP_close_write(QDP_Writer *writer);'
Meaning     Closes an output file.
Example     `QDP_close_write(writer); '

In both cases the integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for
failure.

4.7.2 Reading and writing QDP fields
------------------------------------

Reading a field
...............

Syntax      `int QDP_read_T(QDP_Reader *in, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QDP_TYPE *field);'
Meaning     Reads the field and its metadata from the next record in the
            specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_Real *field = QDP_create_R();
            QDP_read_R(reader, record_xml, field); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has created the `QDP_String' for the record metadata
and the field for the data in advance.  The datatype of the record must
match the field type.

Reading an array of fields
..........................

Syntax      `int QDP_vread_T(QDP_Reader *in, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QDP_TYPE *field[], int n);'
Meaning     Reads the array of fields and its metadata from the next
            record in the specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_ColorMatrix *field[4];
            for(i=0; i<4; i++) field[i] = QDP_create_M();
            QDP_vread_M(reader, record_xml, field, 4); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has created the `QDP_String' for the record metadata
and the fields for the data in advance.

Reading only the record information
...................................

It may be convenient to examine the record metadata first to decide
whether to read or skip the accompanying binary data.

Syntax      `int QDP_read_record_info(QDP_Reader *in, QDP_String
            *record_xml);'
Meaning     Reads the only the metadata from the next record in the
            specified file.
Example     `QDP_read_record_info(reader, record_xml); '

   A subsequent call to `QDP_read_'T returns a copy of the same
metadata along with the lattice field.

Skipping to the next record
...........................

Syntax      `int QDP_next_record(QDP_Reader *in);'
Meaning     Advances to the beginning of the next record.
Example     `QDP_next_record(reader); '

Writing a field
...............

Syntax      `int QDP_write_T(QDP_Writer *out, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QDP_TYPE *field);'
Meaning     Writes the field and its metadata as the next record in the
            specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_Real *field = QDP_create_R();
            QDP_R_eq_zero(field, QDP_all);
            QDP_write_R(writer, record_xml, field); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has created the `QDP_String' for the record metadata
and the array for the data in advance.

Writing an array of fields
..........................

Syntax      `int QDP_write_vT(QDP_Writer *out, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QDP_TYPE *field[], int n);'
Meaning     Writes the array of fields and its metadata as the next
            record in the specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_ColorMatrix *field[4];
            for(i=0; i<4; i++) field[i] = QDP_create_M();
            for(i=0; i<4; i++) QDP_M_eq_zero(field[i], QDP_all);
            QDP_write_vM(writer, record_xml, field, 4); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has prepared the record metadata and the array data in
advance.


File: qdpc.info,  Node: Reading and writing QLA arrays,  Next: String Handling,  Prev: Reading and writing QDP fields,  Up: I/O utilities

4.7.3 Reading and writing QLA arrays
------------------------------------

QLA data is global data that carries no lattice site index.  Typically
these values result from a global reduction. For example, a correlation
function might be computed on every time slice of the lattice and
summed globally over the entire machine.  From the standpoint of data
parallel I/O operation the data is treated as a global quantity with
the same name and value on every processor.  When it is written to a
file, it is assumed that the values are the same on each node, so only
one node needs to write its value.  When it is read from a file, the
I/O system does a broadcast to every node, so the result of reading is
a global value.

   An interface is provided for reading and writing arrays of QLA data.
Single QLA values can be passed as an array of length one.  The naming
conventions for the routines follow conventions of the QDP API.  Notice
that the encoded QLA data type is lower case and the argument is a
pointer to a QLA type.

Reading a QLA array
...................

Syntax      `int QDP_vread_T(QDP_Reader *in, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QLA_TYPE *array, int n);'
Meaning     Reads the QLA array and its metadata from the next record in
            the specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QLA_Complex array[nt];
            QDP_vread_c(reader, record_xml, array, nt); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has created the record metadata and the field data in
advance.

Writing an array of QLA values
..............................

Syntax      `int QDP_write_vT(QDP_Writer *out, QDP_String *record_xml,
            QLA_TYPE *array, int n);'
Meaning     Writes the QLA array and its metadata as the next record in
            the specified file.
TYPE        `S, I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QLA_Complex array[nt];
            QDP_c_eq_V_dot_V_multi(array, prop, src, timeslices, nt);
            QDP_write_vc(writer, record_xml, array, nt); '

The integer return value is 0 for success and 1 for failure.  It is
assumed the user has prepared the record metadata and the field data in
advance.

4.7.4 String Handling
---------------------

The file and record metadata is passed to QDP in `QDP_string' objects.
These can be created, destroyed and converted to/from C strings with
the following routines.

Creating an empty QDP string
............................

Syntax      `QDP_String *QDP_string_create(void);'
Meaning     Creates an empty string.
Example     `fileinfo = QDP_string_create(); '

Destroying a QDP string
.......................

Syntax      `void QDP_string_destroy(QDP_String *xml);'
Meaning     Frees the `QDP_string' object and its contents.
Example     `QDP_string_destroy(xml); '

Set a QDP string from a C string
................................

Syntax      `void QDP_string_set(QDP_String *qstring, char *cstring);'
Meaning     Sets the QDP string to contain a copy of the null-terminated
            character array `cstring'.
Example     `QDP_string *fileinfo = QDP_string_create();
            QDP_string_set(fileinfo, string); '

Copying a QDP string
....................

Syntax      `void QDP_string_copy(QDP_String *dest, QDP_String *src);'
Meaning     Copies the string.
Example     `QDP_string_copy(newxml, oldxml); '

Accessing the string length
...........................

Syntax      `size_t QDP_string_length(QDP_String *qs);'
Meaning     Returns the length of the string.
Example     `length = QDP_string_length(xml); '

Accessing the character string
..............................

Syntax      `char *QDP_string_ptr(QDP_String *qs);'
Meaning     Returns a pointer to the null-terminated character array in
            the string.
Example     `printf("%sn", QDP_string_ptr(xml)); '

4.8 Temporary entry and exit from QDP
=====================================

For a variety of reasons it may be necessary to remove data from QDP
structures.  Conversely, it may be necessary to reinsert data into QDP
structures.  For example, a highly optimized linear solver may operate
outside QDP.  The operands would need to be extracted from QDP fields
and the eventual solution reinserted.  It may also be useful to suspend
QDP communications temporarily to gain separate access to the
communications layer.  For this purpose function calls are provided to
put the QDP implementation and/or QDP objects into a known state,
extract values, and reinsert them.

Exposing QDP data
-----------------

Syntax      `QLA_TYPE * QDP_expose_T(TYPE *src);'
Meaning     Deliver data values from field `src'.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `r = QDP_expose_M(a);'

This function grants direct access to the data values contained in the
QDP field _src_.  The return value is a pointer to an array of QLA data
_dest_ of type _T_.  The order of the data is given by `QDP_index'.  No
QDP operations are permitted on exposed data until `QDP_reset' is
called. (See next.)

Returning control of QDP data
-----------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_reset_T(TYPE *field);'
Meaning     Returns control of data values to QDP.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_reset_M(r);'

This call signals to QDP that the user is ready to resume QDP
operations with the data in the specified field.

Extracting QDP data
-------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_extract_T(QLA_TYPE *dest, TYPE *src);'
Meaning     Copy data values from field `src' to array `dest'.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_extract_M(r, a, QDP_even);'

The user must allocate space of size
`QDP_sites_on_node*sizeof(QLA_Type)' for the destination array before
calling this function, regardless of the size of the subset.  This
function copies the data values contained in the QDP field _src_ to the
destination field.  Only values belonging to the specified subset are
copied.  Any values in the destination array not associated with the
subset are left unmodified.  The order of the data is given by
`QDP_index'.  Since a copy is made, QDP operations involving the source
field may proceed without disruption.

Inserting QDP data
------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_insert_T(TYPE *dest, QLA_TYPE *src);'
Meaning     Inserts data values from QLA array `src'.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_insert_M(a, r);'

Only data associated with the specified subset are inserted.  Other
values are unmodified.  The data order must conform to `QDP_index'.
This call, analogous to a fill operation, is permitted at any time and
does not interfere with QDP operations.

Extracting QDP data to a packed array
-------------------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_extract_packed_T(QLA_TYPE *dest, TYPE *src);'
Meaning     Copy data values from field `src' to array `dest'.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_extract_M(r, a, QDP_even);'

The user must allocate space of size
`QDP_subset_len(subset)*sizeof(QLA_Type)' for the destination array
before calling this function.  This function copies the data values
contained in the QDP field _src_ to the destination field.  Only values
belonging to the specified subset are copied and they are stored
contiguously in the destination array.  The order of the data is given
by `QDP_index'.  Since a copy is made, QDP operations involving the
source field may proceed without disruption.

Inserting QDP data from a packed array
--------------------------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_insert_packed_T(TYPE *dest, QLA_TYPE *src);'
Meaning     Inserts data values from QLA array `src'.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_insert_M(a, r);'

Only data associated with the specified subset are inserted.  Other
values are unmodified.  The data order must conform to `QDP_index'.
This call, analogous to a fill operation, is permitted at any time and
does not interfere with QDP operations.

Suspending QDP communications
-----------------------------

If a user wishes to suspend QDP communications temporarily and carry on
communications by other means, it is first necessary to call
`QDP_suspend_comm'.

Syntax      `void QDP_suspend_comm(void);'
Meaning     Suspends QDP communications.
Example     `QDP_suspend_comm();'

   No QDP shifts can then be initiated until `QDP_resume' is called.
However QDP linear algebra operations without shifts may proceed.

Resuming QDP communications
---------------------------

To resume QDP communications one uses

Syntax      `void QDP_resume_comm(void);'
Meaning     Restores QDP communications.
Example     `QDP_resume_comm();'

4.9 Optimization Calls
======================

The following procedures are included to aid in optimization of the QDP
implementation

Marking discarded data
----------------------

Syntax      `void QDP_discard_T(TYPE *a);'
Meaning     Indicates data in `a' is no longer needed.
TYPE        `I, R, C, V, H, D, M, P'
Example     `QDP_discard_M(utemp);'

The field is not destroyed and memory is not released.  For that
purpose, see `QDP_destroy'.  This call allows the implementation to
ignore the data dependency that may have been created from a shift
which allows the shift to be efficiently reused later.  It is a runtime
error to attempt to use discarded data as an rvalue (source operand or
incremented destination) in any subsequent operation.  However, once
the field is used as an lvalue (fully replaced destination), data
integrity is automatically reinstated.

   This should be called on the result of a shift once the result is no
longer needed.  It is safe to call it for any field as long as the data
is no longer needed.  It is highy recommended for the sake of
efficiency that one always call this as soon as the result of a shift
is no longer needed.  It can also be used to make sure that a field is
not being used elsewhere without first being set since using a
discarded field without first setting it produces an error.

Block size operations
---------------------

Syntax      `int QDP_get_block_size(void);'
Meaning     Returns the block size.

Syntax      `void QDP_set_block_size(int bs);'
Meaning     Sets the block size.

   These functions allow one to set the block size used for the
operations on arrays of QDP fields.  Instead of running over all sites
of each field individually, it can run over a few sites for each field
in turn and then move to the next few sites on each field and so on
until all sites are done.  The number of sites done at a time is
determined by the block size.

Memory alignment
----------------

Syntax      `int QDP_get_mem_align(void);'
Meaning     Returns the default memory alignment.

Syntax      `void QDP_set_mem_align(int align);'
Meaning     Sets the default memory alignment.

   Some architectures might perform better for fields with certain
alignments.  This allows one to set the default alignment used when
fields are created.  It only affects newly created fields.  Currently
the default is set to 16 bytes if not set by the user which should be
sufficient for most current platforms.  It is expected that the QDP
library will automatically use whatever value is necessary to utilize
the optimized QLA routines for architectures which QLA has been
optimized for.  Therefore the user normally would not need to set this
and it is recommended that they don't unless they specifically find it
useful for a platform not already optimized in QLA.  The user can also
use the macro `QDP_ALIGN_DEFAULT' to specify the default alignment
provided by QMP for that machine.

Memory attributes
-----------------

Syntax      `int QDP_get_mem_flags(void);'
Meaning     Returns the default memory flags

Syntax      `void QDP_set_mem_flags(int flags);'
Meaning     Sets the default memory flags
Example     `QDP_set_mem_flags(QDP_MEM_FAST|QDP_MEM_COMMS); '

   This allows the user to set the characteristics of the memory used
for newly created fields if the architecture supports them.  The QDP
memory flags have the same meaning as the corresponding QMP flags.  The
integer value is the combination (bitwise or) of the flags given below.
The actual effect of each combination is specific to the implementation
and the architecture.

Memory Flag            Meaning
QDP_MEM_NONCACHE       Use noncached memory.
QDP_MEM_COMMS          Use memory that is optimized for communucations.
QDP_MEM_FAST           Use fastest memory available (such as EDRAM on
                       QCDOC).
QDP_MEM_DEFAULT        Use default value for architecture (from QMP).

5 Function Details
******************

This section describes in some detail the names and functionality for
all functions in the interface involving linear algebra with and
without shifts.  Because of the variety of datatypes, and assignment
operations, there are a few hundred names altogether.  However, there
are only a couple dozen categories.  It is hoped that the construction
of the names is sufficiently natural that with only a little practice,
the user can guess the name of any function and determine its
functionality without consulting a list.

   In prototype specifications throughout this document the notation
TYPE specifies the generic or specific datatype name matching the
abbreviation T according to the table in *note Datatypes::.  We also
introduce the shorthand

   `#define SUBSET QDP_Subset subset'

   Unless otherwise indicated, operations occur on all sites in the
specified subset.
